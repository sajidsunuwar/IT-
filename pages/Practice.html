Computing may encompass the design and development of software and hardware systems for a broad range of purposes - often structuring, processing and managing any kind of information</font> - to <mark>aid in the pursuit of scientific studies, making intelligent systems, and creating and using different media for entertainment and communication.</mark>Computing has also been defined as a branch of engineering science that deals with the systematic study of algorithmic processes, which are used to describe and transform information. 
		<br/><br/>It also has specific meanings depending on the context and field in which it is used. <u>For example, cloud computing, social computing, <i>ubiquitous computing</i>, parallel computing</u> and grid computing all fall under the umbrella of <s>the general meaning of computing while still having a specific purpose and definition separate from each other.</s> Essentially, these are different applications of computing. 
		<br/><br/><b>No matter how you define it, though, computing all boils down to one big fundamental question: What can be successfully automated?</b>
